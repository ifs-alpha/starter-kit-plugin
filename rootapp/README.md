# Bedrock

## What is Bedrock ?

Welcome to **Bedrock**! But what is it ? **Bedrock** is here to help you, as a squad, to install and deploy all of your architecture and help you bootstrap your product, technically speaking.

In this tutorial, together, we will help you install all of your infrastucture to host your database, your cluster, your buckets !

Once your infrastucture is ready, please refer to the related tutorials. :warning: Create tutorials for deployment :construction_worker:

For all of these aspects, we'll provide you a **step by step** guide, with screenshots and everything you may need to understand **what** to do, **where** you need to do it, and **why** you need to do it.

## Let's dive in !

So now, you should be ready to dive into installing all of these things you need.

So what are we going to do now ? First we'll use **StarterKits** to deploy your infrastructure on IBM Cloud. Then we'll see how to deploy your application.
